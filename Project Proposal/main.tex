\paragraph{Document Overview}
This document follows the university's Iteration 1.1 guidelines for Initial Vision and Planning. It outlines the project vision, high-level features, and a near-term iteration plan aligned with the course schedule. A detailed breakdown of user stories and requirements will be provided in the next iteration submission.

% ===================== 2. Project Vision =====================
\section{Project Vision}
\subsection*{Vision Statement}
Our project delivers a \textbf{web-based local work marketplace} where anyone can post small jobs and nearby providers \textbf{bid} to win them. By centering discovery on a map and implementing \textbf{KYC for all users}, escrowed payments, and transparent reviews, we help posters get trustworthy help quickly and providers find nearby work efficiently. We will work iteratively and incorporate feedback at each stage.

\subsection*{Problem Statement}
Informal local services in the Toronto GTA such as home repairs, moving help, yardwork, and small trades are fragmented across classifieds and social platforms, leading to high search costs, price opacity, and safety concerns. Consumers lack verified identity signals and protected payment flows, while providers face lead uncertainty, travel inefficiency across dispersed neighborhoods, and payment risk. GTA-specific factors-high population density with strong neighborhood heterogeneity, significant travel-time variability, and documented fraud/scam exposure-exacerbate these frictions. A map-first marketplace with mandatory identity verification (KYC), escrowed payments, and on-platform messaging/reviews can reduce search and trust costs, enable fair price discovery, and improve job completion outcomes in the GTA.

\subsection*{Target Users}
\begin{itemize}[leftmargin=1.4em]
  \item \textbf{Job Posters}: individuals or small businesses needing short tasks (e.g., repairs, yard work, errands).
  \item \textbf{Job Bidders}: KYC verified individuals who can earn income from small jobs.
  \item \textbf{Job Browser}: anyone can visit the website and browse jobs.
\end{itemize}

\subsection*{Project Goals}
\begin{itemize}[leftmargin=1.4em]
  \item Ship an intuitive, map-first marketplace for posting, bidding, and completing jobs.
  \item Increase trust with \textbf{mandatory KYC}, Duo-based 2FA, escrowed payments, and reviews.
  \item Ensure privacy and safety with approximate locations pre-acceptance and phone masking post-acceptance.
  \item Build on a pragmatic stack: \textbf{React + SCSS (Firebase Hosting), Node.js + Express, Firebase Firestore}.
\end{itemize}

% ===================== 3. High-Level Features =====================
\section{High-Level Features}
\subsection*{1. Core Marketplace}
\begin{itemize}[leftmargin=1.4em]
  \item Post jobs with photos, budget (fixed or open), category, and date.
  \item Bid on jobs with amount, note, and ETA; accept/decline; anti-sniping window (optional).
  \item Escrowed payments (hold $\rightarrow$ capture on completion; refund/dispute flow).
  \item Ratings and reviews on completion.
\end{itemize}

\subsection*{2. In-App Messaging \& Negotiation}
\begin{itemize}[leftmargin=1.4em]
  \item Secure real-time chat between posters and providers linked to each job.
  \item Chat is available from the moment a bid is placed; posters and bidders can negotiate price, clarify scope, and attach images/documents.
  \item Messages are logged in Firestore under `/messages/{messageId}` per job, enabling dispute resolution and moderation.
  \item Notifications (push + SMS proxy fallback) alert users of new messages.
  \item For safety, personal phone/email contact info is blocked or masked until a job is awarded.
\end{itemize}

\subsection*{3. Safety, Identity \& Trust}
\begin{itemize}[leftmargin=1.4em]
  \item \textbf{KYC for all users} (document + selfie) before posting/bidding.
  \item Duo Security 2FA for login and sensitive actions.
  \item Neighborhood Safety Score (0--100) informing friction: tips, daylight defaults, verified-only, or manual review.
  \item Background checks for providers (where permitted; consent required).
  \item Phone and exact address masking after acceptance; report/block; moderation queue.
\end{itemize}

\subsection*{4. Maps \& Discovery}
\begin{itemize}[leftmargin=1.4em]
  \item Map-based job discovery: clustering, radius filtering, category/budget/date filters.
  \item Address autocomplete and validation; forward/reverse geocoding.
  \item Optional time-to-site sorting (distance matrix) in later iterations.
\end{itemize}

\subsection*{5. Customer Support \& Contact}
\begin{itemize}[leftmargin=1.4em]
  \item In-app "Contact Us" form available under profile/settings.
  \item Support tickets stored in Firestore and routed to admin dashboard.
  \item Automatic email confirmation sent to user upon submission.
  \item Options for common categories: billing, identity verification, job disputes, technical issues.
  \item Escalation path: tickets auto-flagged for urgent review if related to payments or safety.
  \item Future enhancement: live chat or chatbot triage.
\end{itemize}

\subsection*{6. Reporting \& Analytics}
\begin{itemize}[leftmargin=1.4em]
  \item Basic dashboards: job throughput, bid velocity, completion rates.
  \item Admin tools: dispute intake, category management, policy/config tuning.
\end{itemize}

\end{itemize}

% ===================== 7. Task Allocation =====================
\section{Planning: Task Allocation (Agile Rotation)}
\textbf{Principle:} Everyone works across frontend, backend, and Firebase. Pairs rotate weekly in a round-robin so each member pairs with every other member during the term.

\paragraph{Process}
\begin{itemize}[leftmargin=1.4em]
  \item Sprint cadence: 1-week sprints with backlog refinement and sprint review each Friday.
  \item Daily stand-up: 10 minutes; blockers captured as GitHub issues.
  \item Rotation: Two pairs per week; cycle repeats every 3 weeks.
  \item Scrum Master: rotates weekly (Tyler $\rightarrow$ Mani $\rightarrow$ Yanness $\rightarrow$ Alaister, then repeat).
  \item Quality gates: PR requires one reviewer outside the pair, passing tests, lint compliance.
\end{itemize}
